Hillsdale Community Foundation
About
The Hillsdale Community Foundation exists to strengthen community among those who live and work in Hillsdale.The Foundation organizes community events; supports our schools and other institutions; beautifies and sustains our environment; and helps neighbors in need. We are supported by generous, and grateful, community members through donations, bequests, and volunteerism. 

We stage an annual Book Sale. We care for the Central Hillsdale area along Capitol Highway by funding landscape watering and maintenance, and being the umbrella organization for volunteers (known as The Usual Suspects) who pick up litter every month. We hope to commission a mural to decorate the plaza (which we were instrumental in building). We act as the fiscal agent for the Hillsdale Assistance Team, and contribute to their work of aiding those who are homeless. We sponsor free concerts at the Josh Kadish Community Stage, which we built in partnership with the Hillsdale Food Park. We’ve run Easter egg hunts and a scavenger hunt. During the pandemic, our “Stand Up Hillsdale” campaign raised over $30,000 for Neighborhood House.

Read on and contact us to learn how you can become part of the change we want to see in Hillsdale.

History
In early 2006, The Hillsdale Alliance, an informal organization of representatives from a coalition of Hillsdale civic groups, decided to establish the non-profit Hillsdale Community Foundation. To fund it, Alliance volunteers began the Hillsdale Book Sale, selling thousands of books donated by the community. The first sale was in the summer of 2006. Over the years, book sales have raised thousands for the Foundation.

The Foundation itself was launched in 2009 when it began making grants for community projects. In early 2011, the Foundation contributed to and managed the three-year-long Hillsdale Main Street program, using matching funds from the City of Portland. Main Street led the community to undertake numerous improvement projects in the commercial “Hillsdale Town Center.”

Starting in 2014, the Foundation board made grants of approximately $5,000 annually to individuals and organizations requesting funds for qualifying community undertakings.

In 2018, the Foundation changed its focus to building community by supporting events that bring people together. 

Foundation-supported projects have included:

Josh Kadish Community Stage construction, dedication and concerts
Hillsdale Easter Egg Hunt
Installation of several bike racks in the Town Center
The creation of a plaza between Basics and Baker & Spice
A grant for computers at Wilson (now Wells) High School
The installation and maintenance of plantings along Capitol Highway in the commercial area
The fundraiser Stand-Up Hillsdale 2019 COVID-19, raising more than $30,000 for  Neighborhood House
Improvements to commercial-area parking and pedestrian safety
The installation and maintenance of signage, banners, and murals
An incentive-matching contribution to the Hopewell House Hospice for improving patient support
Partial funding for a new playground at Rieke Elementary School
A new "Welcome to Hillsdale" sign
Money for landscaping along the 25th Avenue “Safe Routes to School” project
"Speak Up for Schools" session for SUN Schools
Staging a solar fair
Donations to Community Partners for Affordable Housing in appreciation of its donation of Watershed facilities for the annual book sale

Looking For New Board Members
Join the Hillsdale Community Foundation
The Hillsdale Community Foundation needs new board members. We are a group of volunteers dedicated to building strong community in Hillsdale by organizing and promoting events that bring people together. We welcome your energy and compassion to help make this happen and your fresh ideas for new events that will make Hillsdale even friendlier. Together we create an accessible, inclusive, and beautiful community for everyone.

Anyone interested in building community in Hillsdale is welcome to apply to be on our board. We strive to have our board reflect all aspects of our community because we understand the richness and depth diversity brings to our community. We value ideas from adults of all ages and socioeconomic groups, from the BIMPOC and LGBTQ communities, from people whose focus is on children, and from people of different religious beliefs. If you are part of any underrepresented community, we would particularly welcome you. Join us with your ideas and passion for Hillsdale. We look forward to working alongside you to bring those ideas to life.

Hillsdale Assistance Team (HAT)

The Hillsdale Assistance Team (HAT) is a group of local volunteers working to help those suffering from homelessness and problems associated with it. HAT formed in 2021 to provide basic sanitary needs to an encampment of young people living under the Bertha Viaduct. When the encampment fell victim to drug use and petty crime, the City closed it. At that point, HAT joined with other local groups working to provide housing and support for the homeless in the larger area.

HAT’s work now consists of:

Contributing money for food and clothing vouchers to homeless children in our local public schools.
Providing small emergency grants through volunteers.
Tabling at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market to inform patrons about tiny house villages and homelessness in general.
Supporting SW Outreach’s help for campers along Barbur Boulevard.
Lobbying for more tiny house sites and, in the process, learning about government involvement and barriers.
Supporting the work of Friends of Multnomah Safe Rest Village and other groups.
Working with SW Faith Coalition, supporting its public forums on homelessness.

What you can do

Volunteer and join HAT’s Zoom meetings: 2nd Tuesday, 7 p.m.

Going Solar
Interested in going solar but you rent your home or can’t afford to invest in panels? Maybe you're like Michael Reunert, past president of the Hillsdale Community Foundation. When he had a solar company come and take a look at his roof, he was told, “You would have to cut your trees, and your neighbor's trees, to get enough sun on your roof.”

But you can switch to solar and save money without a sunny roof. How? By subscribing to solar electricity generated at a project elsewhere in PGE’s service area and getting credit against your bill. 

Watch a YouTube video from Oregon Shines explaining how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fDbe3F7-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fDbe3F7-I).

Subscribe through the Hillsdale Community Foundation here, and both you and the Foundation will receive a $25 e-gift card. Help yourself, your community, and the environment all at once!
